      <div><span class="bold">Kakinada district</span> is a district in the Coastal Andhra Region in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. With Kakinada as its administrative headquarters, it was proposed on 26 January 2022 to become one of the resultant twenty six districts in the state after the final notification has been issued on 4 April 2022 by the government of Andhra Pradesh. The district was formed from Kakinada and Peddapuram revenue divisions from East Godavari district.[2][3][4][5] Incidentally, during earlier times, the region comprising towns Pithapuram, Kakinada and Peddapuram were referred as Polnaud[6] or Prolunadu (prōlunāḍu),[7] which now roughly corresponds to the areas in this district.[8]</div>
